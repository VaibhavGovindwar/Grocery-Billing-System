# Grocery-Billing-System

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based billing system for a grocery store. It allows users to enter item names and their prices, calculates the total cost, and applies a 5% discount on the final bill. The program outputs a neatly formatted bill using the `PrettyTable` library for a professional look. The program continuously accepts input until the user decides to quit by typing "q", and then displays the final total with the discount applied.

## Features

- **Itemized Bill**: Add multiple items with their prices and see a well-structured bill.
- **Discount Calculation**: Automatically applies a 5% discount on the total amount.
- **Input Validation**: The system continuously accepts valid input until the user decides to quit.
- **Neat Formatting**: The final bill is displayed in a tabular format using the PrettyTable library.
